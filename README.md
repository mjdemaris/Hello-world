# Hello-world
My first anything to do with Git and GitHub.
I want to change careers, do something that is fun, and needed for years to come.  I have about 2 years of coding in VBA, working with MS Access databases; a few months experiementing with SQL Server Express...and I want to move on to Data Analysis or Cyber Security.  So, I am looking for MVA courses on Azure to see what it's all about and experiment a bit, and came accross GitHub.
